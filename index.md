# 'Appetizers!'

From **15 to 19 March 2021** we will have the second edition of The Skin of Things ([previously](https://theskinofthings.github.io)) - a multidisciplinary gathering centered around the perception and depiction of materials. Just like many other conferences we will go on-line, with some regret as the previous Skin of Things was such a nice social event in and around the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. 

To accommodate this melancholia, we thought of something to make up. Besides being a stage to share (almost) finished work we also invite to share preliminary ideas and work. If you are willing to join and contribute to these 'Appetizers', we promise to organize the 'Main Dish' where we can reflect and discuss the results in person, when the time comes. 

Besides looking back and looking forward, we also look sideways by programming exciting contributions from different perspectives. In the oncoming months we will design the program and we would like to consider many different contributions. Below we'll explain the type of contributions and the daily themes. 




# Talk types
## Keynote and invited speakers. 
Each day there will be at least 1 invited speaker that is related to the daily theme. On the main day (without theme) we will have a keynote. 

## Regular talk
This is a talk that you would normally give on a conference, i.e. about 10-15 minutes long about a research project that is close to being submitted for a journal. 

## Appetizer talk
The appetizer talks are meant to start new research, have community discussions, collaboration ideas etc. In early stages of ideation it can be very helpfull and inspiring to share your thoughts with a broad group of experts from different fields. Perhaps you want to share some preliminary sketches, experiments, data or merely thoughts. 


# Themes

## General
**Keynote:** [Donald Hoffman](https://www.cogsci.uci.edu/~ddhoff/) <br>
We will have one day to discuss material perception and depiction in a broad context. 


## Food 
**Theme speaker:** TBA<br>
The perception and depiction of food is a theme that connects the mastery of still life painters with packaging design, mutlisensory experience and product photography. The human faculty to visually infer material properties may actually be substantially due to the need to identify and prepare food. 


## Art making
**Theme speaker:** [Viola Eickmeier](https://studioviolet.org)<br>
Many process of making are iterative and contain steps or stages that merit inspection themselves, next to the final result. This holds for painting as well as many other art or design processes. 

## Style 
**Theme speaker:** TBA<br>
One of the most exciting aspects of depiction is style. The simple algebraic truth that artwork=representation+style has intrigued art historians, designers, artists and vision scientists for ages, and recently has literally become algebraic with neural style transfer algorithms. 


## Digital
**Theme speaker:** TBA<br>
A very broad term, that we will happily misuse to combine both digital art history and digital rendering. Digital art history is a very broad term that includes aspects from technical art history and conservation science but also the generation and analysis of artistic datasets. Digital rendering has clearly had its own 'oil revolution' over the past 2 decades and is still in high pace development, including generative algorithms. 




# Submission
We will update when we know what submission system we will use, for dates see below.
