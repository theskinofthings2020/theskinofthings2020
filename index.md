# About

From **15 to 19 March 2021** we will organize the second edition of The Skin of Things ([previously](https://theskinofthings.github.io)) - a multidisciplinary gathering centered around the *perception and depiction of materials*. Just like many other conferences we will go on-line, with some regret as the previous Skin of Things was such a nice social event in and around the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. 

To accommodate this melancholia, we thought of something to make up. Besides being a stage to share (almost) finished work we also invite to share preliminary ideas and work. If you are willing to join and contribute to these 'Appetizers', we promise to organize a 'Grande Bouffe' when the time comes to meet physically.  

Besides looking back and looking forward, we also look sideways by programming exciting contributions from different perspectives. We aim to create a program that includes many different  disciplines and views. Below we'll explain the type of contributions and the daily themes. 





# Programme

Each day between 15 to 19 March we will have meetings between 15:00 and 18:00 Central European Time (CET). Luckily, Daylight Saving Time in the US starts earlier than Europe, so there will be a time difference of 5 (east coast) to 7 hours (west coast).  

In the three hours we will have plenty of time for discussions, improvisations and surprises.
