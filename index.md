# About

From **15 to 19 March 2021** we will have the second edition of The Skin of Things ([previously](https://theskinofthings.github.io)) - a multidisciplinary gathering centered around the *perception and depiction of materials*. Just like many other conferences we will go on-line, with some regret as the previous Skin of Things was such a nice social event in and around the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. 

To accommodate this melancholia, we thought of something to make up. Besides being a stage to share (almost) finished work we also invite to share preliminary ideas and work. If you are willing to join and contribute to these 'Appetizers', we promise to organize a 'Grande Bouffe' when the time comes to meet physically.  

Besides looking back and looking forward, we also look sideways by programming exciting contributions from different perspectives. We aim to create a program that includes many different contributions. Below we'll explain the type of contributions and the daily themes. 





# Themes

Each day we will discuss a different theme/perspective. The themes have a little bit 

## General
**Keynote:** [Donald Hoffman](https://www.cogsci.uci.edu/~ddhoff/) <br>
We will have one day to discuss material perception and depiction in a broad context. 


## Food 
**Theme speaker:** John Hutchings <br>
The perception and depiction of food is a theme that connects the mastery of still life painters with packaging design, mutlisensory experience and product photography. The human faculty to visually infer material properties may actually be substantially due to the need to identify and prepare food. 


## Art making
**Theme speaker:** [Viola Eickmeier](https://studioviolet.org)<br>
Many process of making are iterative and contain steps or stages that merit inspection themselves, next to the final result. This holds for painting as well as many other art or design processes. 


## Style 
**Theme speaker:** TBA<br>
One of the most exciting aspects of depiction is style. The simple algebraic truth that artwork=representation+style has intrigued art historians, designers, artists and vision scientists for ages, and recently has literally become algebraic with neural style transfer algorithms. 


## Digital
**Theme speaker:** TBA<br>
A very broad term, that we will happily misuse to combine both digital art history and digital rendering. Digital art history is a very broad term that includes aspects from technical art history and conservation science but also the generation and analysis of artistic datasets. Digital rendering has clearly had its own 'oil revolution' over the past 2 decades and is still in high pace development, including generative algorithms. 




# Submission
We welcome two types of contributions: Main Dishes and Appetizers. The Main Dishes are general contributions that aim to share (almost) finished work. The Appetizers are preliminary ideas, pilot experiments, unfinished research for which feedback, discussion or even collaborators are needed. 

Abstracts can be send to <img src="images/emailtsot.jpg" alt="drawing" height="18"/>. Please included 1) title, 2) author names, 3) type (Appetizers or Main Dish) and 4) preferred theme in the document. You can use word, textfile, etc as long as we can copy the contents easily. 

# Timeline
